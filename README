Libg19 is a small library based on libusb-1.0 for interacting with
logitech G19 keyboards.  If you're not a develoepr, and just looking
to get your keyboard working with GNU/Linux, this will not be of much
use to you.

If you're looking to get your keyboard functional with GNU/Linux,
checkout the kernel modules ali1234 has put together, along with
running Gnome15.

Kernel Modules: https://github.com/ali1234/lg4l
Gnome15: http://www.gnome15.org/

Current features:
    - LCD and L-Keys
    - M-Keys and G-Keys
    - M-Key backlighting
    - Keyboard backlighting color

Requirements:
    - libusb-1.0

To build, you should be able to just run the Makefile, assuming you
have libusb-1.0 installed.
